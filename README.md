# CSS Art Playground
Hey there everybody! I found this cool video on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD10-PocoQQ) 
that shows how to make art using only CSS and HTML. After seeing it, I thought to myself "I want to do that!",
so here I am to try my hand at it.

## What I'm Going To Make
I'm a gamer at heart and it's a big part as to why I pursued software development. To showcase that
I plan on making art for the controllers of consoles that I played growing up!
More specifically (& in order of when I first played):
- Nintendo 64 ✅
- PlayStation 2 ✅
- Nintendo Gamecube
- ~~Nintendo Wii~~
- ~~Playstation 3~~
- ~~Playstation 4~~
- Nintendo Switch

## What I Hope To Learn
Between the mixture of various curves, colors, and shadings I think going through the different controllers
can offer a fun challenge when it comes to finding the right CSS settings (i.e position, box-shadow, border-radius, etc).
I hope to familiarize myself with CSS settings that I normally wouldn't even touch and also get better acquainted with
settings that I use constantly, but may not know how to use them fully.

## The Progress/Updates
#### 12/1/2022
> It's been a bit since I've last touched my art project, so I though it'd be good to give an update! After some thought I decided to consolidate the project. The goal of this project was to push myself with CSS, so I removed the Wii and PS3 & 4 controllers. More Specifically the Wii-mote is very simple, being just a rectangle. And the PS3 & 4 controllers remain very similar to the PS2, with the PS3 being virtually the same design. So for those reasons I removed them.

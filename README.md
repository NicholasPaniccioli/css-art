# CSS Art Playground
Hey there everybody! I found this cool video on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD10-PocoQQ) 
that shows how to make art using only CSS and HTML. After seeing it, I thought to myself "I want to do that!",
so here I am to try my hand at it.

## What I'm Going To Make w
I'm a gamer at heart and it's a big part as to why I pursued software development. To showcase that
I plan on making art for the controllers of consoles that I played growing up!
More specifically (& in order of when I first played):
- Nintendo 64
- PlayStation 2
- Nintendo Gamecube
- Nintendo Wii
- Playstation 3
- Playstation 4
- Nintendo Switch

## What I Hope To Learn
Between the mixture of various curves, colors, and shadings I think going through the different controllers
can offer a fun challenge when it comes to finding the right CSS settings (i.e position, box-shadow, border-radius, etc).
I hope to familiarize myself with CSS settings that I normally wouldn't even touch vvvvvvand also get better acquainted with
settings that I use constantly but may not know how to use them fully.
